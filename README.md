**DESCRIPTION**:

Description of FIR Filter Design and Simulation

As part of the CodTech VLSI Internship, Task 4 involved the design and simulation of a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) digital filter using Verilog. FIR filters are essential components in digital signal processing (DSP) used to smooth signals, eliminate noise, and shape frequency responses.

ðŸ”§ Design Overview
The FIR filter designed here is a 3-tap filter with the equation:

Edit
y[n] = h0*x[n] + h1*x[n-1] + h2*x[n-2]
x[n] is the current input sample.
h0, h1, and h2 are the filter coefficients.
y[n] is the output.

In this design:
h0 = 1, h1 = 2, and h2 = 1 â€” a simple symmetric low-pass filter.
Input x_in is 8-bit wide.
Output y_out is 16-bit wide to accommodate the sum of products.
Three 8-bit shift registers (x_reg0, x_reg1, x_reg2) store the current and two previous input samples to compute the filter output on every rising clock edge.

ðŸ§ª Testbench Functionality
The testbench tb_fir_filter drives the FIR filter module:
It toggles the clock every 5ns (#5 delay).
It resets the filter, then applies a sequence of input samples: 10, 20, 30, 0, 5.
The expected output is the weighted sum of the last three inputs on each clock edge.

The waveform generation commands:

$dumpfile("fir.vcd");
$dumpvars(0, tb_fir_filter);
enable visual inspection of the signal transitions using a waveform viewer like EPWave or GTKWave.

ðŸ§  Output Behavior
The output y_out follows the FIR equation. For example:
After inputting: x[0] = 10 â†’ y = 1*10 + 2*0 + 1*0 = 10
Then: x[1] = 20 â†’ y = 1*20 + 2*10 + 1*0 = 40
Then: x[2] = 30 â†’ y = 1*30 + 2*20 + 1*10 = 80
Each new sample pushes older values through the shift registers, mimicking real-time digital filtering behavior.

ðŸ›  Tools Used
The FIR filter and testbench were simulated using EDA Playground with the Icarus Verilog simulator. The platform allows:
Verilog code editing and execution in the browser
Visual waveform analysis using EPWave
Fast validation of logic designs without installing local tools

âœ… Conclusion
This task effectively demonstrated the implementation and simulation of a basic FIR filter using Verilog HDL. The filter uses a pipelined shift register structure, multiply-and-accumulate logic, and clocked behavior â€” all fundamental to DSP systems. The simulation confirmed correct functionality and helped visualize the time-based filtering effect, reinforcing concepts of signal sampling, weighting, and digital delay lines.
